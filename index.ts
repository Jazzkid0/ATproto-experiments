// A command line interface for the ATPROTO API, used to interact with bluesky.
// Uses the various tools in this directory to do so.



// The plan is to put a cli here using whatever tools I end up making.
// Idk if it'll ever be fun or practical. The code will probably look gross also with nested readline interfaces or whatever.
// Maybe I can put each command within their own tool without getting rid of the use of command line arguments either.
