# Bluesky CLI stuff

This is a rough collection of tools for interacting with the Bluesky API from the command line. It's not at all polished.

I'm using this repo to learn, and you can too!
Fork at your leisure, and feel free to ask me about it on Bluesky @jazzkid.bsky.social

Bluesky API documentation can be found here: [https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/api](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/api)

This is built from code provided by Alice! She's on bluesky too: @aliceisjustplaying.bsky.social
